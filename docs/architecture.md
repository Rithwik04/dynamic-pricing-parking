## üìù Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of the system architecture of the **Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots** project.

The architecture is designed to:
- Process real-time data streams
- Compute pricing dynamically based on demand, competition, and external factors
- Provide smooth and explainable pricing decisions
- Optionally recommend rerouting vehicles when lots are full

## üîÑ Workflow Stages

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Input Data

We start with a **historical dataset**:
- 18,368 records covering 14 urban parking lots
- Data spans 73 days, with 18 time points per day
- Features include:
  - Occupancy
  - Capacity
  - Queue length
  - Vehicle type (car, bike, truck)
  - Nearby traffic conditions
  - Special day indicator
  - Latitude and longitude for each lot
  - Timestamp

This data is placed in `data/dataset.csv`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Ingestion Layer

The **Pathway** stream processing engine simulates a real-time data feed from the dataset.  
Key tasks:
- Stream records one by one, preserving their chronological order.
- Mimic real-world sensor or IoT data streams.
- Feed data into the feature engineering and pricing logic modules.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

At each time step, we extract and compute:
- **Occupancy Ratio** = current occupancy / capacity
- **Queue Length** = vehicles waiting
- **Traffic Level Weight**: mapping `low`, `medium`, `high` to numeric weights
- **Special Day Indicator**: binary (0/1)
- **Vehicle Type Weight**: cars, bikes, trucks assigned different weights

These features serve as inputs to the pricing models.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pricing Engine

We implement three progressive models of increasing sophistication:

#### Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing
- Adjusts the price linearly based on occupancy ratio:
  \[
  P_{t+1} = P_t + \alpha \cdot \frac{\text{occupancy}}{\text{capacity}}
  \]
- Simple, easy-to-interpret, but doesn‚Äôt consider other features.

#### Model 2: Demand-based Pricing
- Builds a weighted demand function:
  \[
  \text{Demand} = \alpha_1 \cdot \text{Occupancy Ratio} + \alpha_2 \cdot \text{Queue} - \alpha_3 \cdot \text{Traffic} + \alpha_4 \cdot \text{Special Day} + \alpha_5 \cdot \text{Vehicle Weight}
  \]
- Normalizes demand and adjusts the price smoothly.

#### Model 3: Competitive Pricing (Optional)
- Adds geo-intelligence by analyzing competitors:
  - Computes distance to nearby lots.
  - Factors in their prices.
  - Suggests rerouting vehicles to cheaper/less crowded nearby lots.
  - Dynamically adjusts price to remain competitive.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Output & Visualization

The system outputs:
- Real-time price updates for each parking lot
- Optional rerouting suggestions
- Visualizations via **Bokeh**, including:
  - Price evolution over time
  - Competitor comparisons
  - Queue and occupancy trends

Bokeh outputs are saved in `visuals/pricing_visuals.html`.

## üßæ Design Principles & Assumptions

‚úÖ Real-time, low-latency performance using Pathway  
‚úÖ Smooth and explainable pricing (bounded: **$5‚Äì$20**)  
‚úÖ Scalable to more parking lots and more complex features  
‚úÖ No external ML libraries ‚Äî only Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `Pathway`)  
‚úÖ Modular structure for easy extensibility
